            "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the stairs. His closet of a room was under the roof of a high, five-floor house and was more like a cupboard than a place in which to live. The landlady who provided him with the room and with dinner and service lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which was always open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him grimace and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her.\n",
            "\n",
            "This was not because he was cowardly and browbeaten, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from everyone else that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but even the anxieties of his position had recently ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. In fact, nothing that any landlady could do held any terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, all the while racking his brains for excuses, avoiding the issue, lying — no, he would rather creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, when he emerged onto the street that evening, he became acutely aware of his fears.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm . . . yes, everything is in someone’s hands and they let it all slip out of cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is people are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most . . . But I am talking too much. It’s because I babble that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I babble because I do nothing. I’ve learned to babble this last month, lying for days on end in my corner thinking . . . just nonsense. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that seriously possible? I’m not serious about it at all. It’s just a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle, the plaster, the scaffolding, the bricks and the dust all around him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to everyone who is unable to get out of town during the summer — all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The unbearable stench from the taverns, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a weekday, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the deepest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, though, he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was around him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, because he used to talk to himself, he would mutter something, a habit to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had had almost nothing to eat.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that part of town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Due to the proximity of the Haymarket, the number of establishments of a certain kind and the overwhelming numbers of craftsmen and workers crowded in these streets and alleys at the center of Petersburg, so many different types of people were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however strange, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated spite and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the cares of youth, he minded his rags least of all. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge cart dragged by a heavy cart-horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past, “Hey there, German hatter,” bellowing at the top of his voice and pointing at him — the young man stopped suddenly and clutched trembling at his hat. It was a tall round one from Zimmermann’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most hideous fashion. Not shame, however, but another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\n",

He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing \\u00a8C and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened.The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it.Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft.Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.\\\\Accio Cloak!\\\\\\\" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.\\\\\\\"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\\\\\\\" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. \\\\\\\"Spread now. He's here.\\\\\\\"Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters' searching wands.\\\\\\\"Let's just leave!\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered. \\\\\\\"Disapparate now!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Great idea,\\\\\\\" said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, \\\\\\\"We know you are here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"They were ready for us,\\\\\\\" whispered Harry. \\\\\\\"They set up that spell to tell them we'd come. I reckon they've done something to keep us here, trap us \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What about dementors?\\\\\\\" called another Death Eater. \\\\\\\"Let'em have free rein, they'd find him quick enough!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" 'an dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. He'll be easier to kill if he's been Kissed first!\\\\\\\"There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately.\\\\\\\"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered.Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in - He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered \\\\\\\"Expecto Patronum!\\\\\\\"The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight\\\\\\\"It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\\\\\\\"The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: \\\\\\\"Potter, in here, quick!\\\\\\\"He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway.\\\\\\\"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\\\\\\\" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him.Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness.Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog's Head's barman, was the only person not wearing a hood.\\\\\\\"So what?\\\\\\\" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \\\\\\\"So what? You send dementors down my street, I'll send a Patronus back at'em! I'm not having'em near me, I've told you that. I'm not having it!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"That wasn't your Patronus,\\\\\\\" said a Death Eater. \\\\\\\"That was a stag. It was Potter's!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Stag!\\\\\\\" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. \\\\\\\"Stag! You idiot \\u00a8C Expecto Patronum!\\\\\\\"Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight.\\\\\\\"That's not what I saw\\\\\\\" said the Death Eater, though was less certainly \\\\\\\"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise,\\\\\\\" one of his companions told the barman. \\\\\\\"Someone was out on the streets against regulations \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark Marks, and summoned him. He's not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Don't worry about us.\\\\\\\" said one of the Death Eaters, \\\\\\\"worry about yourself, breaking curfew!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Are you threatening \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!\\\\\\\" shouted the first Death Eater.\\\\\\\"Stag?\\\\\\\" roared the barman. \\\\\\\"It's a goat, idiot!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"All right, we made a mistake,\\\\\\\" said the second Death Eater. \\\\\\\"Break curfew again and we won't be so lenient!\\\\\\\"The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.The barman entered the room.\\\\\\\"You bloody fools,\\\\\\\" he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \\\\\\\"What were you thinking, coming here?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Thank you,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!\\\\\\\"The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.\\\\\\\"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror.\\\\\\\"There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other.\\\\\\\"You sent Dobby.\\\\\\\"The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.\\\\\\\"Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left him?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's dead,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\\\\\\\"The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, \\\\\\\"I'm sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.\\\\\\\"He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them.\\\\\\\"You're Aberforth,\\\\\\\" said Harry to the man's back.He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire.\\\\\\\"How did you get this?\\\\\\\" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.\\\\\\\"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\\\\\\\"Ron gasped.\\\\\\\"The silver doe,\\\\\\\" he said excitedly, \\\\\\\"Was that you too?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What are you talking about?\\\\\\\" asked Aberforth.\\\\\\\"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my Patronus is a goat?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"Yeah... well, I'm hungry!\\\\\\\" he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.\\\\\\\"I got food,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire.Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing.\\\\\\\"Right then,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. \\\\\\\"We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm's set off, they'll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you'll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We're not leaving,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"We need to get into Hogwarts.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Don't be stupid, boy,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth.\\\\\\\"We've got to,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\\\\\\"What you've got to do,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth, leaning forward, \\\\\\\"is to get as far from here as from here as you can.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore \\u00a8C I mean, your brother \\u00a8C wanted us \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.\\\\\\\"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth, \\\\\\\"and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don't owe him anything.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You don't understand.\\\\\\\" said Harry again.\\\\\\\"Oh, don't I?\\\\\\\" said Aberforth quietly. \\\\\\\"You don't think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I did?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I didn't mean that,\\\\\\\" said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. \\\\\\\"It's... he left me a job.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Did he now?\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\\\\\\\"Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.\\\\\\\"I-it's not easy, no,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"But I've got to \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?\\\\\\\" said Aberforth roughly. \\\\\\\"Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I can't.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Why not?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. \\\\\\\"But you're fighting too, you're in the Order of the Phoenix \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I was,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.\\\\\\\" He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione.\\\\\\\"They'll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with you.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I can't leave,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I've got a job \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Give it to someone else!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?\\\\\\\"Harry wanted him with all his heart to say \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking.\\\\\\\"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural.\\\\\\\"The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.\\\\\\\"Mr. Dumbledore\\\\\\\" said Hermione rather timidly. \\\\\\\"Is that your sister? Ariana?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes.\\\\\\\" said Aberforth tersely. \\\\\\\"Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\\\\\\\"Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red.\\\\\\\"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,\\\\\\\" said Harry, trying to spare Hermione.\\\\\\\"That old berk,\\\\\\\" muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \\\\\\\"Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every ocrifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.\\\\\\\"Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers': The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it.\\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a low voice.\\\\\\\"Did he now?\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" asked Hermione breathlessly.\\\\\\\"Never you mind,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth.\\\\\\\"But that's a really serious thing to say!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Are you \\u00a8C are you talking about your sister?\\\\\\\"Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.\\\\\\\"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\\\\\\\"Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.\\\\\\\"It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And my father went after the bastards that did it,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth, \\\\\\\"and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn't keep it in any longer.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I was her favourite,\\\\\\\" he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth's wrinkles and wrangled beard. \\\\\\\"Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day,\\\\\\\"Aberforth succored. \\\\\\\"He didn't want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there.\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"If I'd been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, and... it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed.\\\\\\\"Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it.\\\\\\\"So that put paid to Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of 'em came home for my mother's funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!\\\\\\\"Aberforth spat into the fire.\\\\\\\"I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed home and done it.He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks... till he came.\\\\\\\"And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth's face.\\\\\\\"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\\\\\\\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \\\\\\\"I told him, you'd better give it up now. You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that.\\\\\\\" said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \\\\\\\"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother... Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And there was an argument... and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend \\u00a8C and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound.\\\\\\\" \\u00a8C and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't know which of us did it, it could have been any of us \\u00a8C and she was dead.\\\\\\\"His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it.\\\\\\\"I'm so... I'm so sorry,\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered.\\\\\\\"Gone,\\\\\\\" croaked Aberforth. \\\\\\\"Gone forever.\\\\\\\"He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat.\\\\\\\" 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He was never free,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\\\\\\"I beg your pardon?\\\\\\\" said Aberforth.\\\\\\\"Never,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please... hurt me instead.' \\\\\\\"Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake.The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.\\\\\\\"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\\\\\\\" said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading.\\\\\\\"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana... It was torture to him, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.\\\\\\\"Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. \\\\\\\"How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?\\\\\\\"A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.\\\\\\\"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.\\\\\\\"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then?\\\\\\\" shot back Aberforth. \\\\\\\"Why didn't he say to him, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive'?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Because,\\\\\\\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \\\\\\\"sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You're seventeen, boy!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Who says I've given up?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\\\\\\\" Harry repeated, \\\\\\\"You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No, it isn't.\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going until I succeed \\u00a8C or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\\\\\\\"He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved.\\\\\\\"We need to get into Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Harry again. \\\\\\\"If you can't help us, we'll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us \\u00a8C well, now would be a great time to mention it.\\\\\\\"Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana.\\\\\\\"You know what to do,\\\\\\\" he said.She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.\\\\\\\"Er \\u00a8C what \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\" began Ron.\\\\\\\"There's only one way in now,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"You must know they've got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded.How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies... well, that's your lookout, isn't it? You say you're prepared to die.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But what...?\\\\\\\" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture.A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait.Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled.\\\\\\\"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"In the Hog's HeadHermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to Vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I was wondering,' Hermione said suddenly, 'whether you'd thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Course I have,' said Harry grumpily, 'can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I meant the idea Ron and I had - ' Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look. She frowned at him, '- Oh, all right, the idea I had, then - about you teaching us.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters - found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' he said slowly, when he could no longer pretend to find Asiatic Anti-Venoms interesting, 'yeah, I - I've thought about it a bit.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And?' said Hermione eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I thought it was a good idea from the start,' said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, 'but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck. Rubbing it, he said, 'Yeah? What did Vicky say?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ho ho,' said Hermione in a bored voice. 'He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You're not still in contact with him, are you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So what if I am.?' said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little pink. 'I can have a pen-pal if I - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He didn't only want to be your pen-pal,' said Ron accusingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, 'Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Just you and Ron, yeah?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again. 'Well . . . now, don't fly off the handle again, Harry, please . . . but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we're talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort. Oh, don't be pathetic, Ron. It doesn't seem fair if we don't offer the chance to other people.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry considered this for a moment, then said, 'Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I'm a nutter, remember?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,' said Hermione seriously. 'Look,' she leaned towards him - Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forwards to listen too - 'you know the first weekend in October's a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who's interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why do we have to do it outside school?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Because,' said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, 'I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.'*Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying they didn't want him to come - but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about,' said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. 'I mean, he's been on the run for over two years, hasn't he, and I know that can't have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn't he? And now he's just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The trouble is,' she said to Harry, 'until V-Voldemort - oh, for heaven's sake, Ron - comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn't he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn't going to realise Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore's been telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again, it'll be obvious Sirius isn't one . . . I mean, he hasn't got the Mark, for one thing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly. 'Dumbledore'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn't like what he hears.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't worry, Harry,' Hermione said quietly. 'You've got enough on your plate without Sirius, too.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Alter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - why was Filch sniffing you?' asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at: a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh. T forgot to tell you . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him off?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging. 'Maybe Malfoy he'd think it was a laugh.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Malfoy?' said Hermione, sceptically. 'Well . . . yes . . . maybe . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Where are we going, anyway?' Harry asked. The Three Broomsticks?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh - no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 'no, it's always packed and really noisy. I've told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road. I think it's a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar's severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog's Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: 'Yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head,' he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon's egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them Dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't know about this, Hermione,' Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. 'Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Umbridge is shorter than that woman,' she said quietly. 'And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I've double- and triple-checked the school rules. We're not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed. I just don't think it's a good idea if we parade what we're doing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry drily, 'especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The barman sidled towards them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 What? he grunted.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Three Butterbeers, please,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Six Sickles,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'll get them,' said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman's eyes travelled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. The man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know what?' Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. 'We could order anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn't care. I've always wanted to try Firewhisky - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You - are - a - prefect,' snarled Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh,' said Ron, the smile fading from his face. 'Yeah . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?' Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Just a couple of people,' Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. 'I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh, look, this might be them now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A couple of people?' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. 'A couple of people?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily. 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have . . . twenty-five Butterbeers, please?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out. 'Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What have you been telling people?' he said in a low voice. 'What are they expecting?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. 'Well - er - hi.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you're here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, 'And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?' said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course I do,' said Hermione at once. 'But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because . . . because . . .' she took a great breath and finished, 'because Lord Voldemort is back.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The reaction was immediate and predictable. Clio's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well . . . that's the plan, anyway,' said Hermione. 'If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back?' said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Dumbledore believes it - ' Hermione began.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You mean, Dumbledore believes him,' said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Who are you?' said Ron, rather rudely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Zacharias Smith,' said the boy, 'and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people - maybe even most of them - had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry's story firsthand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What makes me say You-Know-Who's back?' he repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the face. 'I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him, you won't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Zacharias said dismissively, 'All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts. He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,' Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho. 'I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He cast an angry look in Hermione's direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So,' said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. 'So . . . like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we're going to do it, how often we're going to meet and where we're going to - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Is it true,' interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, 'that you can produce a Patronus?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry slightly defensively.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A corporeal Patronus?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The phrase stirred something in Harry's memory.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - you don't know Madam Bones, do you?' he asked.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The girl smiled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She's my auntie,' she said. 'I'm Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So - is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Blimey, Harry!' said Lee, looking deeply impressed. 'I never knew that!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Mum told Ron not to spread it around,' said Fred, grinning at Harry. 'She said you got enough attention as it was.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She's not wrong,' mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore's office?' demanded Terry Boot. That's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - yeah, I did, yeah,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said 'Wow!' softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, 'he saved that Philological Stone - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Philosopher's,' hissed Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, that - from You-Know-Who,' finished Neville.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hannah Abbotts eyes were as round as Galleons.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And that's not to mention,' said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) 'all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year - getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry's insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' he said, and everyone fell silent at once, 'I . . . I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot of help with all that stuff . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not with the dragon, you didn't,' said Michael Corner at once. 'That was a seriously cool bit of flying . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well - ' said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry, 'no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?' said Zacharias Smith.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Here's an idea,' said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, 'why don't you shut your mouth?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Perhaps the word 'weasel' had affected Ron particularly strongly. In any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we've all turned up to learn from him and now he's telling us he can't really do any of it,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's not what he said,' snarled Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Would you like us to clean out you: ears for you?' enquired Greorge, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, well, said Hermione hastily, moving on . . . the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred's hand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Right,' said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. 'Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hang on,' said Angelina, 'we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Cho, 'nor with ours.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor ours,' added Zacharias Smith.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,' said Hermione, slightly impatiently, 'but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well said!' barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. 'Personally, I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we'll do this year, even with our OWLs coming up!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry 'Surely not!' When nobody spoke, he went on, 'I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period. Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione, 'is that she's got some . . . some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he'd mobilise us against the Ministry'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, 'Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, he's got an army of Heliopaths,' said Luna solemnly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No, he hasn't,' snapped Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, he has,' said Luna.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What are Heliopaths?' asked Neville, looking blank.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, 'great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, yes, they do!' said Luna angrily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sorry, but where's the proof of that?' snapped Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There are plenty of eye-witness accounts. Just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hem, hem,' said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. 'Weren't we trying to decide how often we're going to meet and have defence lessons?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione at once, 'yes, we were, you're right, Ginny.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, once a week sounds cool,' said Lee Jordan.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'As long as - ' began Angelina.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,' said Hermione in a tense voice. 'Well, the other thing to decide is where we're going to meet . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Library?' suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Maybe an unused classroom?' said Dean.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Ron, 'McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Tri wizard.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,' said Hermione. 'We'll send a message round to everybody when we've got a time and a place for the first meeting.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,' she took a deep breath, 'that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing. So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we're up to.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er . . .' said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him, 'well . . . I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - well, we are prefects,' Ernie burst out. 'And if this list was found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,' Harry reminded him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - yes,' said Ernie, 'yes, I do believe that, it's just - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around?' said Hermione testily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No. No, of course not,' said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. 'I - yes, of course I'll sign.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. When the last person - Zacharias - had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, time's ticking on,' said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. 'George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we'll be seeing you all later.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I think that went quite well,' said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry and Ron were clutching their bottles of Butterbeer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't like him much, either,' admitted Hermione, 'but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really - I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn't have come if he hadn't been going out with Ginny - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed Butterbeer down his front.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He's WHAT?' spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. 'She's going out with - my sister's going - what d'you mean, Michael Corner?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, that's why he and his friends came, I think - well, they're obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael what was going on - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'When did this - when did she -?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,' said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window. 'Hmm . . . I could do with a new quill.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Which one was Michael Corner?' Ron demanded furiously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The dark one,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I didn't like him,' said Ron at once.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Big surprise,' said Hermione under her breath.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But, said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, 'I thought Ginny fancied Harry!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn't like you, of course,' she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black and gold quill.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry, whose head was still full of Cho's parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So that's why she talks now?' he asked Hermione. 'She never used to talk in front of me.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Exactly,' said Hermione. 'Yes, I think I'll have this one . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, with Ron still breathing down her neck.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ron,' she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, 'this is exactly why Ginny hasn't told you she's seeing Michael, she knew you'd take it badly. So don't harp on about it, for heaven's sake.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What d'you mean? Who's taking anything badly? I'm not going to harp on about anything . . .' Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was still muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, 'And talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What d'you mean?' said Harry quickly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold - had he been that obvious?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Hermione, smiling slightly, 'she just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.\",\n          \"OWLsRon's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of 'Weasley is our King' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right, obviously, his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left - his right, I mean - and - well - you saw what happened,' he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest\\u00a0 \\u00a0 to them - a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepulis - had heard him. 'And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later - What?' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face. 'Why are you grinning?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. 'I'm just glad we won, that's all.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though . . .' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - ' said Harry\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, actually . . . no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. 'As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron's carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 'You didn't watch?' he said faintly, looking from one to the other. 'You didn't see me make any of those saves?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well - no,' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him. 'But Ron, we didn't want to leave - we had to!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah?' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. 'How come?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It was Hagrid,' said Harry. 'He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the Forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. Anyway . . .\\\\\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He brought one back and hid it in the Forest?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yep,' said Harry grimly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. 'No, he can't have.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly. 'Grawps about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,' she snorted, 'as Hermy.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron gave a nervous laugh.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. 'Yes, I'm starting to think he has. But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly. 'I mean, come on . . . we've got exams and we're about that far - ' he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching '- from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid's monster mates?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I know, it's just that - we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' he sighed, 'Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he? He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all.'*The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze. June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How many hours d'you think you're doing a day?' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron. 'A few.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'More or less than eight?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest. 'Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eights my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course, it's not what you know,' he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, 'it's who you know. Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years - old Griselda Marchbanks - we've had her round for dinner and everthing . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Do you think that's true?' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them. 'Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's she like, Neville?' asked Hermione at once. 'Is she strict?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it?' Ron told him encouragingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably. 'Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad . . . well . . . you saw what she's like at St Mungo's\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione, we wanted to buy that!' shouted Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 'You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dingle's got powdered dragon claw?' said Ron eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not any more,' said Hermione. 'I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dragon claw does work!' said Ron. 'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly. 'I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried Doxy droppings.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 'your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new - Headmistress - ' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt '- has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' - however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'An owl will be sent to you some time in July,' said Professcr McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, 'so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks' time, waiting for his OWL results. Well, he thought dully', at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why don't you just do it yourself?' he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, my goodness,' she said faintly, staring into the Entrance Hall. 'Is that them? Is that the examiners?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Shall we go and have a closer look?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Journey was fine, journey was fine, we've made it plenty of times before!' she said impatiently. 'Now, I haven't heard from Dumbledore lately!' she added, peering around the Hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. 'No idea where he is, I suppose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'None at all,' said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. 'But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I doubt it,' shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, 'not it Dumbledore doesn't want to be found! I should know . . . examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs . . . did things with a wand I'd never seen before.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes . . . well . . .' said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, 'let me show you to the staff room. I daresay you'd like a cup of tea after your journey.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to do some last-minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did. He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. He knew he was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 None of the fifth-years talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once breakfast was over, the fifth- and seventh-years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons; then, at half past nine, they were called forwards class by class to re-enter the Great Hall, which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were all seated and quiet, she said, 'You may begin,' and turned over an enormous hour-glass on the desk beside her, on which there were also spare quills, ink bottles and rolls of parchment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard - three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling - and lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll . . . smiling slightly, he bent over the paper and began to write.*'Well, it wasn't too bad, was it?' asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. 'I'm not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time. Did you put in the counter-charm for hiccoughs? I wasn't sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much - and on question twenty-three - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione,' said Ron sternly, 'we've been through this before . . . we're not going through every exam afterwards, it's bad enough doing them once.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The fifth-years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour), then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until called for their practical examination. As small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements, occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she kit the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She'll be fine, remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our Charms tests?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, 'Parkinson, Pansy - Patil, Padma - Patil, Parvati - Potter. Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good luck,' said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Professor Tofty is free, Potter,' squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter, is it?' said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. 'The famous Potter?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him; the wine-glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's it,' he said in his quavery old voice, 'no need to be nervous. Now, if I could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 On the whole, Harry thought it went rather well. His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy's had been, though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Colour Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake. He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards. He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was no time to relax that night; they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day; Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to Vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minute; while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well); and then, on Thursday, Deience Against the Dark Arts. Here, tor the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, bravo!' cried Professor Tolty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell. 'Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter . . . unless . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He leaned forwards a little.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Expecto patronum!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excellent!' he said. 'Very well, Potter, you may go!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on telling anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an 'Outstanding' OWL.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision. They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the Forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining - he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little - when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad-tempered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How were the Runes?' said Ron, yawning and stretching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I mis-translated ehwaz,' said Hermione furiously. 'It means partnership, not defence', I mixed it up with eihwaz.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ah well,' said Ron lazily, 'that's only one mistake, isn't it, you'll still get - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, shut up!' said Hermione angrily. 'It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what's more, someone's put another Nifiler in Umbridge's office. I don't know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off - by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good,' said Harry and Ron together.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It is not good!' said Hermione hotly. 'She thinks it's Hagrid doing it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He's teaching at the moment; she can't blame him,' said Harry, gesturing out of the window.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, you're so naive sometimes, Harry. You really think Umbridge will wait for proof?' said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off towards the girls' dormitories, banging the door behind her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,' said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least - and which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, he found the written paper difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he could describe its effects accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected, it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings, he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks said, 'Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,' Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had, with luck, avoided a fail.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Only four exams left,' said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Only!' said Hermione snappishly. 'I've got Arithmancy and it's probably the toughest subject there is!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first-years for giggling too loudly in the common room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday's Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: Knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle; feed and clean out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns; and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would give a sick unicorn.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window. When Harry's examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back to the castle.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Astronomy theory paper on Wednesday morning went well enough. Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all Jupiter's moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Even by Harry's low standards in Divination, the exam went very badly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we were always going to fail that one,' said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realise he had been describing his examiner's reflection.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Still, at least we can give it up now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry. 'No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And from now on, I don't care if my tea-leaves spell die, Ron, die - I'm just chucking them in the bin where they belong.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I think I've done all right in Arithmancy,' she said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. 'Just time for a quick look over our star-charts before dinner, then . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o'clock, they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star-chart they had been given.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets the) were observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then ar hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the: ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus's position. Jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrids windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and, not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, Harry hastily bent over his star-chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,' he said softly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ahem - twenty minutes to go,' said Professor Tofty.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star-chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mis-labelled Venus as Mars. He bent to correct it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people cried 'Ouch!' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No!' cried Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'My dear!' said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice. This is an examination!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star-charts any more. Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid's cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him; he was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, 'Be reasonable, Hagrid!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hagrid roared, 'Reasonable be damned, yeh won' take me like this, Dawlish!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him; the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he, too, was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look!' squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now, really!' said Professor Tofty anxiously. 'Only sixteen minutes left, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But nobody paid him the slightest attention: they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside Hagrid's cabin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How dare you!' the figure shouted as she ran. 'How dare you!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's McGonagall!' whispered Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Leave him alone! Alone, I say!' said Professor McGonagall's voice through the darkness. 'On what grounds are you attacking him? He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione, Parvati and Lavender all screamed. The figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than lour Stunners at Professor McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her; for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red, then she lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her back, and moved no more.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Galloping gargoyles!' shouted Professor Tofty, who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely. 'Not so much as a warning! Outrageous behaviour!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'COWARDS!' bellowed Hagrid; his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle. 'RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O' THAT - AN' THAT - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh my - ' gasped Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw Hagrid double over, and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell. But, on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back - then Harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Get him, get him!' screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid's fists; indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck. Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed; and Hagrid, running full-pelt towards the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a long minute's quivering silence as everybody gazed open-mouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty's voice said feebly, 'Um . . . five minutes to go, everybody.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was desperate for the exam to end. When it came at last he, Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were going to bed; they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That evil woman!' gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage. Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's,' said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hagrid did well, didn't he?' said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. 'How come all the spells bounced off him?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It'll be his giant blood,' said Hermione shakily. 'Its very hard to Stun a giant, they're like trolls, really tough . . . but poor Professor McGonagall . . . four Stunners straight in the chest and she's net exactly young, is she?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dreadful, dreadful,' said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. 'Well, I'm off to bed. Night, all.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,' said Ron. 'I 'spect he's gone to join Dumbledore, hasn't he?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I suppose so,' said Hermione, who looked tearful. 'Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we've lost Hagrid too.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But why sack Hagrid now?' asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. 'It's not like Trelawney; he's been teaching much better than usual this year!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Urnbridge hates part-humans,' said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. 'She was always going to try and get Hagrid out.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office,' piped up Katie Bell.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, blimey,' said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. 'It's me who's been putting the Nifflers in her office. Fred and George left me a couple; I've been levitating them in through her window.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She'd have sacked him anyway,' said Dean. 'He was too close to Dumbledore.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's true,' said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right,' said Lavender tearfully.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,' said Colin Creevey. 'She didn't look very well.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,' said Alicia Spinnet firmly. 'She's never failed yet.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute revision, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common-room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the three-and-a-half-feet-high stack of notes that Hermione had lent him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their face-down examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He just wanted this to be over, so that he could go and sleep; then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch - he was going to have a fly on Ron's broom - and savour their freedom from revision.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Turn over your papers,' said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hour-glass. 'You may begin '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly, tortuously, he at last began to write an answer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He simply skipped question four (In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century?), thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end. He had a stab at question five (How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence?) but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten: Describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack. He could visualise a heading, in Hermione's handwriting: The formation of the International Confederation of Wizards . . . he had read those notes only this morning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hour-glass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly, and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 . . . the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, hut his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head. What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls . . . he gazed blankly at the back of Parvati's head again. If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls . . . that was it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment. Slowly, he wrote two lines about the foils, then read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione's notes on the Confederation had gone on for pages and pages.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember . . . the Confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted . . . he had written that, too . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hour-glass at the front . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last . . . the black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres . . . his heart was beating very fast now . . . he was going to get there this time . . . when he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal . . . Harry's stomach contracted with fear . . . with excitement . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Take it for me . . . lift it down, now . . . I cannot touch it . . . but you can . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The black shape on the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm . . . heard the high, cold voice say 'Crucio!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Lord Voldemort is waiting . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll have to kill me,' whispered Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Undoubtedly I shall in the end,' said the cold voice. 'But you will fetch it for me first, Black . . . you think you have felt pain thus far? Think again . . . we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor; Harry awoke as he hit the ground, still yelling, his scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around him.\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          6,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
